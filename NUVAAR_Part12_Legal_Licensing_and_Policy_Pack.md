# NUVAAR Omega Full Launch
# Part 12 - Legal, Licensing, and Policy Pack

Language is English only. ASCII only. No special dashes or special spaces. This chapter contains operational legal texts and templates for the NUVAAR website and programs. It is not legal advice. It is a practical baseline that teams can adapt with counsel.

## 1. Site Terms Of Use

Effective date: 2025-10-21
Last updated: 2025-10-21

### 1.1 Who We Are
NUVAAR is a civic and cultural coordination project. The public website provides information, submissions, program materials, and links to community tools. Some functions may require account creation with a third party identity provider.

### 1.2 Agreement To Terms
By accessing or using the site you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the site.

### 1.3 Changes To Terms
We may update these Terms. If we make material changes, we will post a notice on the site. Continued use after the effective date means you accept the new Terms.

### 1.4 Eligibility
You must be at least 16 years old to use interactive features. Local laws may require a higher age in some regions.

### 1.5 Acceptable Use
You agree not to
- Break the law or others rights
- Upload malware or attempt to disrupt the service
- Harass, doxx, or violate the privacy of others
- Infringe intellectual property
- Misrepresent your affiliation or identity

We may suspend or end access if you violate these rules.

### 1.6 User Content And License
You retain ownership of content you submit. You grant NUVAAR a worldwide, non exclusive, royalty free license to host, reproduce, and display your content on NUVAAR services for the purpose of operating the site and programs. You may choose a Creative Commons license for public works published in Atlas. For private works kept inside a Cell, no public license is granted unless you opt in.

### 1.7 Creator Rights
Creators own their works. Public content on the site uses open licenses selected by the author when possible. Brand assets are excluded from open licenses unless stated.

### 1.8 Prohibited Content
No content that is illegal, hateful, sexually exploitative, or incites violence. No sensitive personal data about others without consent. We reserve the right to remove content that violates policy or law.

### 1.9 Feedback
If you send ideas or suggestions you agree that we may use them without obligation or compensation.

### 1.10 Third Party Links
The site may link to third party services. We are not responsible for their content or policies.

### 1.11 Disclaimers
The site is provided as is and as available. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non infringement.

### 1.12 Limitation Of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, NUVAAR and its contributors will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly. In all cases our total liability will not exceed one hundred US dollars USD 100 or the amount you paid to use the service in the past 12 months, whichever is greater.

### 1.13 Indemnity
You agree to defend and hold harmless NUVAAR from claims arising from your use of the site or your violation of these Terms, except to the extent a claim is caused by our breach of law or these Terms.

### 1.14 Governing Law And Disputes
These Terms are governed by the laws of the region where NUVAAR operates its main web service, without regard to conflict of law rules. Where consumer laws provide mandatory protections, those protections apply. Disputes should first be addressed through dialogue and mediation. If unresolved, competent courts in the service region may hear the matter unless local law requires a different venue.

### 1.15 Termination
We may suspend or terminate access for policy or legal violations. You may stop using the site at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive.
