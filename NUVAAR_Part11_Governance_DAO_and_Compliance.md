# NUVAAR Omega Full Launch
# Part 11 - Governance, DAO, and Compliance Infrastructure

Language is English only. ASCII only. No special dashes or special spaces. This chapter defines how NUVAAR makes decisions, moves funds, keeps records, and protects people. It blends human processes and simple web3 tools without forcing crypto on members who do not want it. It is operational and auditable.

## 1. Purpose And Scope

- Make decisions in the open with clear roles and powers.
- Protect dignity and safety while enabling fast small group work.
- Keep a verifiable trail from proposals to payouts to public outcomes.
- Align with common compliance norms without drowning in paperwork.

This document is not legal advice. It is a practical governance and compliance system for a civic and cultural program.
