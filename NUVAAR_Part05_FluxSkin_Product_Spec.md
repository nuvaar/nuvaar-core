# NUVAAR Omega Full Launch
# Part 05 - FluxSkin Product Specification

Language is English only. ASCII only. No special dashes or spaces. This chapter defines FluxSkin as a flagship program that demonstrates bio design of dignity. It is written to be used by product, design, engineering, safety, and operations teams.

## 1. Purpose And Positioning

FluxSkin shows that industrial design can be ethical, repairable, and beautiful. The device family is battery free in normal use, dock powered for charging or sterilization, and designed for quiet daily care without stigma.

Objectives
- Utility with care. The device must be effective and easy to live with.
- Privacy by default. No hidden telemetry. No cloud lock in.
- Repair and reuse. Parts, guides, and pricing make repair the first choice.
- Accessibility. Clear instructions, tactile and visual affordances, and low strength actuation where feasible.
- Sustainability. Materials and packaging treat ecological impact as a real constraint.

Non goals
- Not a medical diagnosis tool. If a program requires regulated claims, spin out a dedicated medical device program with its own QMS.
- Not a data harvesting platform. No tracking pixels or cross site analytics.

## 2. User Scenarios And Requirements

Primary users
- People who need an easy, dignified self care device.
- Caregivers and facilitators in community settings.
- Educators and makerspace mentors who use the device as a teaching object for safe bio design.

Key scenarios
- Daily self care with dock based UV C cycle for self cleaning.
- On the go use without a heavy battery pack.
- Simple service and part replacement at home or in a community repair event.

Top level requirements
- Core function works safely without an app.
- Setup in under 5 minutes with a single fold quickstart guide.
- Clean and dry feedback is visible and tactile.
- All user surfaces are smooth and easy to wipe.
- No glass on exposed surfaces. Minimize seams and dirt traps.

## 3. Industrial Design And Ergonomics

- Form language is calm and reassuring. No aggressive cues.
- Ergonomic shape supports one handed grip and gentle pressure control.
- Texture zones: fine texture for grip areas, satin for easy clean areas.
- Operable by people with limited hand strength or dexterity where possible.
- Clear orientation markings. High contrast but not harsh. Color vision safe choices.
- Dock lines up with magnets and a guiding chamfer. Feedback on correct seating.

Materials
- Shell: graphene reinforced polymer or high quality PC or ABS variants where safe and recyclable.
- Soft interface: biocompatible silicone or TPE where skin contact occurs.
- Fasteners: stainless steel or brass inserts. Avoid proprietary screws.

Finish targets
- Matte 2 to 5 gloss units on grip zones.
- Satin 10 to 20 gloss units on easy clean zones.
- All finishes must resist common cleaners and hand sanitizers.

## 4. Electrical And UV C System

Power and power path
- Battery free in normal operation. Dock provides power for UV C and optional sensors.
- Inductive or pogo pin contacts on dock. Contacts are recessed and keyed to reduce wear.

UV C self cleaning
- UV C emitters are enclosed. Interlocks disable UV C when the dock is open or the device is not fully seated.
- Cycle is time bound with visible countdown. A physical shield prevents line of sight exposure.
- Safety labels are clear and honest. No ultraviolet exposure to users under normal operation.

Safety notes
- Avoid ozone generation. Select wavelengths and materials accordingly.
- Thermal management ensures skin contact surfaces do not exceed safe temperatures.
- UV C LEDs are controlled with a watchdog and dual sensors where possible.

Standards to consider
- Photobiological safety and consumer device guidelines vary by region. Consult relevant standards during certification planning. Work with accredited labs.

## 5. Biosensing Architecture

Scope
- Sensing modules are optional. They must justify their presence with clear user value.

Candidate sensors
- Temperature and humidity for environment awareness.
- Pressure for gentle control feedback.
- pH or conductivity where chemistry adds value in a safe way.

Design rules
- Sensors are modular and replaceable.
- No biometric identification. No face, voice, or gait analytics.
- If any sensor could infer sensitive health status, require explicit opt in and strict data retention limits even for local logs.

Firmware
- Minimal state machine. Clear error codes. Safe defaults on any fault.
- Firmware updates only via physical dock connection. No silent updates.

## 6. Software And Data

- Default mode is offline. No cloud required.
- If a companion app exists, it is optional and only adds clear value like guided care or repair tutorials.
- No background data transit. No third party SDKs for advertising.
- Local logs are limited to maintenance codes and cycles. Users can clear logs with a button sequence.
- If any data export is implemented, it uses a human readable file and a documented schema.

Example local maintenance log schema
```json
{
  "device_id": "FS-2025-000001",
  "fw": "1.0.3",
  "events": [
    {"t": "2025-01-10T10:22:11Z", "code": "UV_CYCLE_OK"},
    {"t": "2025-01-12T09:02:51Z", "code": "TEMP_LIMIT_WARN"},
    {"t": "2025-01-15T21:30:41Z", "code": "DOCK_LATCH_OPEN"}
  ]
}
```

## 7. Safety Engineering

Hazard categories
- Optical radiation exposure.
- Thermal burns or hot spots.
- Electrical shock or short circuits.
- Mechanical pinch points or sharp edges.
- Chemical exposure from materials or cleaners.

Controls
- Design out hazards first. Add interlocks and shields. Use labels last.
- Redundant detection on UV C enable path where feasible.
- Debounce contacts and use fail safe states.
- Ingress protection for expected environments.

Verification
- Bench tests for UV leakage with calibrated sensors.
- Thermal soak tests for worst case ambient.
- Drop tests and vibration tests for transport.
- Abuse tests defined with safety engineers.

## 8. Accessibility And Inclusive Design

- Large readable text with a clear typeface. Minimum 12 pt on device, larger in guides.
- Raised symbols or notches for orientation.
- Low force actuation and grip friendly geometry.
- Clear auditory or haptic feedback for cycle start and end.
- Multilingual manuals available online. Plain language first.

## 9. Right To Repair And Serviceability

Service philosophy
- Users can replace consumables and common wear parts with basic tools.
- Repair guides include photos and torque specs. Exploded diagrams are public.

Service parts list example
- Shell halves left and right.
- Dock latch spring.
- UV C module with connector.
- Silicone interface kit.
- Gasket set.
- Pogo pin pack.
- Fastener kit with spares.

Service flow example
1. Power down and remove from dock.
2. Open with standard screwdriver. No hidden clips that break.
3. Replace part and reseat gaskets.
4. Torque to spec. Run a self check cycle.
5. Log service in the local maintenance log if enabled.

## 10. Manufacturing And Quality

- DFM reviews early with vendors.
- Tooling designed for minimal warp and sink. Ejector and gate placement must not affect cosmetic surfaces.
- Color and texture control with standard chips and written tolerances.
- Incoming quality checks include color, fit, function, and safety interlocks.
- Serialization on PCB and shell for traceability.
- First article inspection with documented deviations and sign off.
- Process capability tracked with simple SPC on key dimensions.

## 11. Environmental Strategy

- Prefer recycled or rapidly renewable materials that meet safety constraints.
- Minimize mixed material assemblies when possible.
- Packaging is curbside recyclable. No plastic windows. Clear disposal instructions.
- Provide take back points for end of life parts in partner locations.
- Publish a lightweight lifecycle snapshot with assumptions and next steps.

## 12. Compliance Pathfinding

- Define markets for launch and list needed marks and reports.
- Plan photobiological, electrical, and material safety tests with accredited labs.
- If markets require radio certifications only for optional modules, modularize those designs to contain scope and risk.
- Maintain a technical file with design, risk analysis, test reports, labels, and manuals.

## 13. Risk Analysis Outline

Use a short, readable format. Avoid jargon when possible.

- Hazard: UV leakage.
  - Cause: latch failure or misalignment.
  - Control: dual interlock, light shield, and self test.
  - Residual: low. Verify with bench tests each batch.
